breakpoints are not focus of this course, Coursera week 6
Just imagine that we have breakpoint and if they are found the $m_H(n)$ would grow slow.

non-breakpoint
dc-dimension
vc-dimension for PLA
linear algebra would be appreciated

Actually, the bound isn't directly putting $m_H(n)$ in Hoeffding's eqn... We're not so lucky: bad things happen, and we need to loose our bounds. However, these constants are not easy to derive, rather they are quite technical and tricky. Unfortunately, vc bound proof would be omitted in this course. (Both are Russian people) (失眠良伴) (Also they don't focus on binary only: regression, multi-class, etc, so the sketch isn't so similar; however the textbook have binary case proof that's easier to understand.)
General idea is that if breakpoints exists, it's slow, and to be specific it shall be of polynomial up to (n-1) times when break happens at (n) -- vc dimension is just (n-1) if first break is (n).

Break implies it's larger than vc dimension; if so, 2^n is impossible to achieve; impossible to shatter.
No larger than vc dimension --> maybe there exists a set of data points that could be shattered.

Theory of Generalization: 舉一反三
確認 Ein 跟 Eout 有點類似
如果資料夠多 & 有露出曙光 (break)

Actually B(n,k) << n^(k-1) for n \geq 2, k \geq 3

VC bound: bad hypothesis happen probability is bounded with exponential and m_H(n)
Vapnik Chervonenkis bound

Good hypothesis set: breaks.
Good data: enough data
舉一反三!!!
Now all that left is a good algorithm to choose low E_\text{in}
Or do I...?
Nope, we still need luck lol

# VC Dimension

*The largest natural number that's not breakpoint*
The most inputs that our hypothesis set \mathcal{H} can *shatter*; to be more specific, there exists some data points of (vc dimension) size and exists some subset of hypothesis that can shatter them.
Good hypothesis set: finite vc dimension; Guarantee E_\text{out} is near E_\text{in}

# Q

不用假設P 的形狀，仍能得到learning 的保證
跟P沒關係
Distribution-Free
假設P 的形狀，或許我們可以得到更強的結論
但是目前在這邊我們不需要這個，就能得到這樣的好結果( E_in ~= E_out )
- Hoeffding; iid is enough
- We already considered the worst situation by define m_H(n) with \max

Multi-Class?
in VC setting, they first use binary case, then consider multi class.

抽?
