# ML, AI, and Human

More often than not, e.g. logistic learning, we may have some guarantee on some figure stating the fate of ourselves; but how to interprete them? This isn't answered in our current ML lecture; it's more likely what an AI should do. This is an area to be explored, s.t. patients can figure this out themselves, or doctors may have more convenient tool to do this.

That is,
1. The hypothesis itself takes effort to make
2. Merely getting an hypothesis isn't enough; we need interpretation.

# QA

- when f isn't so good, e.g. when we have noise or we're bad luck, does this still work?
  - no, it would affect: 資料爛就是資料爛
  - we could somehow try to mitigate the effects of noise... TBA!
    - outlier removal
    - other error function
  - on the other hand, we're *soft formulation* here, since we here, not like PLA, 包容一些soft error, they just cost some scores.
