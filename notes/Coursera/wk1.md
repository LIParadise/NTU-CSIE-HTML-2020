## Part 5 Machine Learning and Other Fields

### 資料探勘 (Data Mining)

"Find if something's interesting from data"
e.g. KDDCup

- Is there some subset related to each other?
  - Some sale figures shall be proportional to each other?

Hence, if the interesting property is depicted as some underlying pattern, function $f$, that we want find hypothesis for, they are practically the same, which is often the case for competitions like KDDCup.
But there's more: data mining may focused on finding *useful info* for human to do other inference tasks, or just find a better ML model for the task.
Also, data mining traditionally prioritizes fast algorithms

### Artifical Intelligence

"Show me intelligent behaviors"
Sounds like ML where we want machines to derive good prediction function, right?
"ML can realize AI, among other routes"
E.g. we could just force compute all results to have 圍棋 AI.

### Statistics

"Statistics could be used to realize ML"
In fact they are really useful in ML!

Traditionally statistics are based on mathematical axioms and/or theorems, so less calculation is needed.
ML on the other hand focuse more on "how do I calculate that result"
