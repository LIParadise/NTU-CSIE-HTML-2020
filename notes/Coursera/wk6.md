# Week 6

## Restrict $\mathscr{m}_\mathcal{H} \left( n \right)$

We can see that break points *limits* growth of following $\mathscr{m}_\mathcal{H} \left( n \right)$.
Question is, can we do it such that it's really of polynomial function? Does the claim in last week work?

## Bounding Function $\mathcal{B}{ \left( N, k \right) }$

Purely combinatorial: don't care input space.
Just gives that the maximum amount of lenghth $N$ vectors where each element are binary-valued and for any $k$ sized subset of them we don't find the full $2^k$, or *no shatter for $k$*.
