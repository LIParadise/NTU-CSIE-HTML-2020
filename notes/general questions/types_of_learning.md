# Reinforcement Learning, Online Learning, etc.

Definition of these techniques?

Is online learning "seeing one instance, update hypothesis, so on and so forth"?
If so, isn't PLA algorithm a kind of online learning?

Can we have reinforcement learning techniques for classifier problems? If so, applying it to the binary linear separable scheme, what would it be? What's the difference between it and our PLA algorithm?

Is there example of *offline reinforcement learning*?
